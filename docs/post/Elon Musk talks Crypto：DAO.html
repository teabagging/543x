Data privacy refers to the area of data protection and security that is responsible for the handling of sensitive data.
Data Scraping
Data scraping or web scraping is the process of extracting information from a website into a spreadsheet or a local file on your computer or database.

Data Validation
Data validation is the process of clarifying the accuracy, integrity and quality of a set of data before it is used.
Date of Launch
A term used for when ICOs will put up their tokens for sale.
Day Trading
Day trading is the practice of frequently buying and selling assets in order to make a profit on intraday changes in their price.
Dead Cat Bounce
A temporary recovery in prices after a prolonged decrease.
Dead Coin
A cryptocurrency that is no longer in existence.

Death Cross
A death cross is a bearish technical trading indicator that occurs when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average, indicating a big sell-off.
Decentralization Maximalism
Decentralization maximalism refers to the belief that decentralization is the best approach and lifestyle to such a degree that any form of regulation does not need to exist.
Decentralization Ratio
The Decentralization Ratio (DR) is the ratio of collateral value that is decentralized over the total stablecoin supply backed for those assets.
Decentralized
Decentralization refers to the property of a system in which nodes or actors work in concert in a distributed fashion to achieve a common goal.

Decentralized API (dAPI)
API services that are intrinsically interoperable with blockchain technology are known as decentralized application programming interfaces (dAPIs). This is an invention of the API3 protocol.

Decentralized Applications
A type of application that runs on a decentralized network, avoiding a single point of failure.
Decentralized Autonomous Initial Coin Offerings 
A method for decentralized funding of projects that introduces a form of governance in the ICO process, allowing backers to vote for the return of their funds if certain conditions are met.

 (DAO)
 (DAO) is founded upon and governed by a set of computer-defined rules and blockchain-based smart contracts.
Decentralized Currency
Decentralized currency refers to bank-free methods of transferring wealth or ownership of any other commodity without needing a third party.

Decentralized Database
A decentralized database is a modern-day storage solution that combines decentralized technologies with cutting-edge computing to randomly store data and files across multiple nodes, delivering high security and unmatched availability while being completely censorship-resistant.
 (DEX)
A peer-to-peer exchange allowing users to trade cryptocurrency without the need for an intermediary.
Decentralized Governance
Decentralized governance refers to the procedures through which a platform's disintermediated, equitable management is carried out for blockchain networks and dApps.

Decentralized GPU
Decentralized GPU infrastructure refers to a distributed network of graphical processing units (GPUs) that offers on-demand access to GPU computing power.
 (DID)
A decentralized identifier, or DID, refers to an ID that can be issued by an autonomous, independent, and decentralized platform that acts as a proof of ownership of digital identity.
